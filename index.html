Gandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the
dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[4][5] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in
what was then Junagadh State.[6] Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and
had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.[6]

During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth
to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission
to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[6] and was from a
Pranami Vaishnava family.[7][8][9] Karamchand and Putlibai had four children: a son, Laxmidas
(c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a second son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).[10][11] and a
third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[12] who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as
Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of
Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj </q>
